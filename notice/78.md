React 觀念
Let's start the section
by discovering what thinking in React is actually all about.
So as you might have noticed by now,
building React applications
requires a completely new mindset
because it's just very different from building applications
with vanilla JavaScript.
So to build React apps,
you not only need to learn how to work
with the React API in practice
like with all the different functions like you state
but you also need to be able to think in React.
So you need to basically enter the React mindset.
Now, once you have both of these skills,
you will have mastered React
and you will be well on your way
to building professional React applications.
Now, what does thinking in React actually mean?
Well, while you're building an application,
thinking in React means
that you have a very good mental model
of how and when to use all the React tools
like components, state, props, general data flow, effects,
and many more.
It's also about always thinking
in terms of state transitions
rather than in element mutations as we have learned before.
Now, you can also view thinking in React as a whole process
which can help us build apps in a more structured way.
And the first step in this process
is to break the desired UI into components
and establish how these components are related
to one another,
so to establish the component tree.
This also includes thinking about reusability
and composability of components.
After that, we can start by building a static version
of the application.
So without any state and interactivity,
and this is great
because by doing this,
we do most of the coding upfront
before having to worry about state and interactivity.
That part comes next,
so in step three where we think about state.
So here we decide when we need state,
what types of state we need
and where to place each piece of state.
Then finally, we think about establishing how data flows
through the application.
This includes thinking about one-way data flow,
child-to-parent communication,
and the way global state should be accessed.
So these points, three and four,
is what we collectively call state management,
which is the main focus of this section.
Now, of course, this is not a rigid process
that we always need to follow to the letter.
In practice, there's always a lot of back and forth
between these different steps
and things are never this linear,
but it's still good to have a process like this
as an overall guideline.
Okay, now, once you really know how to think in React,
you'll be able to answer questions like
how to break up my UI design into components,
how to make some of my components truly reusable,
or how to assemble a user interface
from reusable components.
Now, we also think a lot about state,
like what pieces of state do I need
for the interactivity that I want
and where to then place each of these states,
or in other words,
what component should actually own each piece of state,
or what types of state can or should I use,
and in more general terms,
how to make my data flow through the application.
Now, as you might have noticed,
we already started to talk about some of these topics before
but I still wanted to have one section
where I really focus on some of these skills
so that you can start getting more and more
into the React mindset.
Now, of course, you will only really master these skills
through practice and writing code,
and lucky for you, we will do lots of that in this course.
But we will also take a bit of a theoretical approach
from time to time just like in this video,
because I believe that it's really, really important
that I teach you these things
besides just the React API itself.
And by doing so,
I make this course really as good as possible for you
and in my opinion, way better
than all the other React courses out there.
But anyway, let's now move on
to looking at the fundamentals of state management.
